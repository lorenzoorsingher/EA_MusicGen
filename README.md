# EMBEDDINGS

To generate the embeddings use embedgen.py

just define the path to the folder containing the audio, the stats csv file and the path to the folder where you want to save the embeddings

If needed redefine the `__getitem__` method in the MusicDataset class to fit the needs of your model
